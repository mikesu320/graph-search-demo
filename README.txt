# Generic Graph Search Algorithm uses Algorithm Type to change
# fringe. Child nodes are added to the  priority list structure
# according to the search used.
# mtr = nxn matrix array
# sType = algorithm type ,
#
# dfs - Depth first Search
# bfs - Breadth First search
# dfs with Deeper Priority
# dfs with Breadth Priority (bfs)
# Greedy Search with Manhattan Path Cost function
# A* Search with Manhattan Path cost function.
